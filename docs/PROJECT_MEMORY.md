# Roomora — Project Memory

Session log. Append at the end of every session.

## Session 1 — 2026-05-31 — Day 1 setup
- Approved plan: Next.js 16 full-stack, free-credits-first, parallel kickoff. Plan file: `~/.claude/plans/here-is-the-claude-hashed-biscuit.md`.
- Scaffolded `roomora-app/` via create-next-app → **Next.js 16.2.6, React 19, Tailwind v4, TS, src dir, App Router**. Git initialized inside `roomora-app/`.
- Read Next 16 docs (server/client components, Tailwind v4 CSS `@theme`, `next/font`). Captured gotchas + Sauge Doré tokens + three-agent operating mode in `CLAUDE.md`.
- Added `.env.local.example`, `.env.test.example`.
- i18n decision: replicate prototype's inline `t(en,zh)` via a lightweight `useT()` hook over Zustand `lang` (not react-i18next), for fast, exact parity.
- Next: frontend dev sub-agent ports tokens/fonts/primitives/slider/all screens/modals/mock services (Tasks #2–#3). Engine spike (#4) waits on user keys + photos.

## Session 2 — 2026-05-31 — Phase 1 frontend + engine spike attempt
- **Frontend Phase 1 DONE** (frontend dev sub-agent): full handoff port to Next.js 16 — Sauge Doré tokens (Tailwind v4 @theme), Schibsted Grotesk + Noto Sans SC, all primitives + draggable before/after slider, 9 screens as App Router routes + Auth/Buy/Share modals, bilingual `t(en,zh)`, Zustand store, typed mock service layer. Verified: `tsc` clean, `build` green (11 routes), `lint` clean. Eyeballed landing + setup screenshots — faithful parity. No console errors.
- Committed + **pushed to GitHub** `paristennisbookingassistant-spec/Roomora` (branch `master`; machine had cached gh creds).
- Independent **tester** spawned (background) against local dev server (localhost:3000) vs prototype (localhost:8732) — 9 Phase-1 success criteria.
- **Engine spike (MiniMax): blocked on balance.** Key is valid but only against host `api.minimaxi.com` (NOT minimax.io). Account returns `1008 insufficient balance`. Recorded correct host in `.env.local` (MINIMAX_BASE_URL). Recommended pivot to **fal.ai + Qwen-Image-Edit** (structure-preserving, the research pick) — waiting on FAL_KEY.
- Supabase keys in `.env.local` (URL https://wakijejhpprftavrwipd.supabase.co). Backend not started yet.

## Session 2 (cont.) — Engine spike RESOLVED
- **Engine = Qwen-Image-Edit on fal.ai.** Spike on the real Paris room photo: Qwen preserved exact window/shelves/floor on restyle AND obeyed a targeted "only add a green sofa" edit (kept everything else, even the cardboard box). MiniMax failed both (invents rooms, ignores edits). See DECISIONS.md D1. fal funded with $10. Core technical risk retired.
- Spike artifacts in `../spike/` (qwen_restyle.png, qwen_edit-sofa.png = the proof).

## Session 2 (cont.) — Production deploy LIVE
- **https://roomora-gamma.vercel.app is live** with the real Phase 1 app (200, renders, no console errors).
- Deploy gotcha fixed: repo had app on `master` while Vercel deployed default `main` (README only) → 404. Merged init into app, pushed app to `main` (now the single deploy branch). Vercel project `roomora` had Framework Preset = "Other" (imported when main had only README) → added committed `vercel.json {"framework":"nextjs"}` and deployed via CLI.
- **Deploy control established**: Vercel CLI + token (in `.env.local` as VERCEL_TOKEN), linked to `leos-projects-11d290bd/roomora`. Deploy with `npx vercel --prod --yes --scope leos-projects-11d290bd --token $VERCEL_TOKEN`. Orchestrator can now deploy autonomously each phase.
- TODO Phase 2 deploy: add prod env vars via `vercel env add` (FAL_KEY, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL/ANON_KEY, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, TEST_USER_EMAILS).

## Session 2 (cont.) — Phase 1 VERIFIED on production (CLOSED)
- Independent tester (against live https://roomora-gamma.vercel.app) → **PASS 9/9**: visual parity vs prototype, full flow (Landing→Setup→Generating→Result→Refine), slider drag, bilingual toggle, credit logic (12→spend→refund, danger ≤2), Auth/Buy/Share modals, bottom nav + Designs/Account, anon gating + mock +3 on sign-in.
- Tester flagged "CDN Tailwind / in-browser Babel" warnings — VERIFIED as misattribution from the prototype tab. Production HTML has no CDN/Babel, serves compiled `/_next/static`, no console messages. Production = real optimized Next build. ✅
- Phase 1 done. Next: Phase 2 backend — BLOCKED on a Supabase access token (sbp_...) to run migrations via Management API.

## Session 2 (cont.) — Phase 2 backend deployed
- Backend dev agent built Phase 2: @supabase/ssr clients + middleware, magic-link auth + /auth/callback, profiles + credit_transactions + spend/add RPCs + signup trigger (3 free credits), real auth/credits services (gen/designs still mock), anon 1-free-trial, gated /api/dev/login + /api/dev/reset. Migration applied via Management API.
- Verified: tsc/build/lint green; DB has both tables + 3 functions; dev-login on PROD returns real session cookie (tester@roomora.test), bad token 403, reset works.
- Configured Supabase Auth via Management API: site_url + redirect allowlist (prod + localhost /auth/callback).
- Committed + pushed (main) + deployed to prod via Vercel CLI. Prod env vars pre-loaded (Supabase x3, FAL_KEY, TEST_USER_EMAILS, ROOMORA_DEV_LOGIN_TOKEN).
- Phase 2 tester running against prod (focus: credits persist across reload = server-enforced).
- Dashboard TODO (not blocking): Google OAuth provider not configured (button is placeholder); default Supabase SMTP has rate limits (custom SMTP later for real magic-link volume).

## Session 2 (cont.) — Phase 3 real generation DEPLOYED
- Generation engineer agent built Phase 3: POST /api/generate (server-authoritative credit spend → upload to `rooms` bucket → fal Qwen-Image-Edit → store in `designs` → generations row; refund on failure), real photo-upload UI, real before/after, refine version chains. Migration 0002 (generations) applied; public rooms/designs buckets created.
- Verified locally + DB: real end-to-end test produced a real 1024² PNG, credit 12→11, generations row.
- **Prompt tuning (orchestrator):** v1 output was too timid (barely furnished). Added explicit FURNISH instruction + reworded ARCHITECTURE_LOCK (locks structure, permits furniture). Re-tested on the Paris room → fully furnished Scandinavian living room with window/shelves/chair/proportions preserved. Big quality jump. (`src/lib/prompts.ts`)
- tsc/build/lint green. Committed + pushed (main) + deployed to prod. Phase 3 tester running against prod (upload real photo → furnished same-room restyle → refine → credits).
- Known TODO: anonymous free-trial is client-gated only (server-side hardening commented in /api/generate); radiator-under-window sometimes added (minor, acceptable).

## Session 2 (cont.) — UX fixes from user testing
- **Loosened anon trial to 3 free designs** (counter in store, consumed only on SUCCESS; refine counts too). Pill shows "N free" for anon instead of misleading credits.
- **Fixed large-photo failure** (root cause: 6MB "Test image 2" base64 > Vercel ~4.5MB body limit → /api/generate failed → error screen). `readImageFile` now downscales to ≤1536px JPEG q0.85 client-side (also honors EXIF orientation). Verified: 6MB photo → real Scandinavian restyle, ~21s, no errors, "2 free".
- **Generating screen** now shows the user's actual photo (dimmed + shimmer) with constructive copy ("Designing your {style} room", step labels Layout/Furniture/Lighting/Details, "~10-20s").
- **Landing proof** now interactive: style toggle chips (Scandinavian/Japandi/Bohemian) + one large draggable BeforeAfter slider (was 3 static near-identical tiles).
- Style tiles + landing examples use real generated imagery (flux style tiles in /public/styles, qwen real-room before/afters in /public/examples).
- homedesigns.ai competitor research agent was running (may have completed) — pending review.

## Session 3 — 2026-06-02 — Cycle 2: Save/My Designs + Google sign-in
- **Save + My Designs (real):** reused `generations` table + `saved` column (migration 0003, applied via Management API) + own-row UPDATE RLS. Server route `/api/designs` (POST saves & claims orphaned anon rows; GET lists saved, newest-first). Real `designsService`; `generationId` threaded into store `result`; `doSave` optimistic + rollback; MyDesignsScreen fetches via TanStack Query. Verified locally (save round-trip, DB saved=true). tsc/build/lint green; deployed to prod.
- **Google sign-in:** code wired (`signInWithOAuth` in supabase.ts; onAuthed('google')). **Supabase Google provider CONFIGURED** via Management API (external_google_enabled=true, client_id/secret set; user's Google Cloud OAuth client, redirect URI = .../auth/v1/callback). Needs MANUAL user verification (headless can't complete Google OAuth); consent screen likely in "testing" mode → user must be a Google test user / may see "unverified app" → Advanced → proceed.
- Save/My Designs tester running against prod.
- Deferred next: Share → /share/[id] (RedNote lever, recommended next cycle); real payment; anon server-side hardening; WeChat; desktop parity.

## Session 3 (cont.) — UX polish from user testing
- **Home button**: header logo is now a Link to `/` on every screen; Result has a "Try another room" button; Save button shows persistent "Saved" + filled heart (not just a toast).
- **Em-dashes removed** from ALL UI strings (EN + Chinese ——), replaced with plain punctuation. Code comments + AI prompt left as-is.
- **Delete saved designs**: DELETE /api/designs (sets saved=false, own row) + designsService.unsave + ✕ button on My Designs tiles (TanStack Query invalidate). Verified on prod (2→1).
- **Generating screen**: replaced empty placeholder boxes with a 4-step progress bar (Layout/Furniture/Lighting/Details) over the dimmed user photo; constructive copy.
- **Variations hint**: "Tap to switch" only when >1 version, else "Refine to add more".
- **Landing**: removed redundant 3-icon trust row (interactive before/after carries proof).
- All deployed to prod, tsc/build/lint green each time.

## Session 3 (cont.) — Prompt fidelity fix + Share shipped
- **Prompt fidelity (founding promise):** Industrial (and other styles implying wall materials) were rebuilding the room (brick walls, arched window). FIX: rewrote STYLE_PROMPTS to describe FURNITURE & DECOR only (no brick/concrete/plaster wall instructions) + much stronger ARCHITECTURE_LOCK ("furnish, don't rebuild"; keep exact walls/windows/doors/floor/shape). Validated across ALL 10 styles via montage (spike/fidelity) + live industrial gen on prod — room structure preserved. `src/lib/prompts.ts`. buildRefinePrompt also hardened.
- **Share feature LIVE (task #10):** built in a PARALLEL session (with docs/GTM_PLAN.md + docs/HERO_CREATIVE.md). /api/share (opt-in shared=true), public /share/[id] page (before/after slider + OG tags + "Design your own, free" CTA), ShareModal wired (native share sheet + copy link), migration 0004 (shared column) applied. Verified on prod: share POST 200, /share/[id] renders publicly.
- **PROCESS NOTE:** my `git add -A` accidentally bundled+deployed the parallel Share work untested. It happened to be complete + building + migration applied, so OK — but switched to explicit `git add <paths>` after. Lesson: always `git status` before staging.
- Removed em-dashes from the new Share UI too.

## Session 3 (cont.) — Match-a-photo LIVE + Shop-this-look started
- **Match-a-photo DONE + verified on prod** (task #11): two-step (MiniMax style-only caption → single-image Qwen restyle). Setup "Match a photo" tab enabled (inspiration upload). Live test: Japandi inspiration on the test room kept exact window/shelves/parquet/chair + applied linen sofa, round table, paper-lantern lamp, soft rug. Committed + deployed.
- **Prompt fidelity** confirmed across all 10 styles (furniture-only descriptors + strong lock). buildMatchPrompt added.
- **Shop-this-look (Cycle 3, task #12) building** (background agent): products table + items jsonb migration (0005), sample Awin feed + ingestion, MiniMax `itemizeDesign` + `/api/shop` matcher, "Shop this look" panel on Result. Building against a SAMPLE feed; real Awin feed swaps in via `AWIN_FEED_URL` env on approval. Economics: free to us, retailer pays ~3-8% commission, ~sub-cent itemize cost/view, credits untouched. Plan = Cycle 3 in plan file.
- USER ACTION PENDING: create Awin publisher account + apply to Maisons du Monde & La Redoute → send publisher ID + feed URL.

## Session 3 (cont.) — Shop-this-look LIVE (sample feed)
- **Cycle 3 DONE + verified on prod** (task #12): products table + items jsonb (migration 0005, applied to prod Supabase), sample Awin feed (22 products) ingested, MiniMax `itemizeDesign` + `/api/shop` matcher (search_products SQL fn, OR-tsquery + ts_rank + budget bands), "Shop this look" collapsible panel on ResultScreen with affiliate buy cards + commission disclosure. Live test: /api/shop on a real design → 4 groups (sofa/coffee_table/rug/plant) with sensible matches (e.g. "round wooden coffee table" → Otto Round Walnut €329). Panel renders well.
- Itemization cached on generations.items. Cron route /api/cron/ingest-products gated by CRON_SECRET (returns 503 until set — safe/inert).
- **TO GO LIVE FOR REAL:** user creates Awin account + advertiser approvals → set `AWIN_FEED_URL` + `CRON_SECRET` in Vercel; nightly cron then refreshes real products. Zero code change.

## Session 4 — 2026-06-03 — Awin feed hardening (pre-connection de-risk)
- Reviewed full Awin pipeline ahead of connecting the real feed. Found a latent bug: both the cron parser (`src/lib/shop/feed.ts`) and CLI (`scripts/ingest-awin.mjs`) matched only the sample header `advertiser`, but real Awin Create-a-Feed exports use `merchant_name` (and vary id/image tokens). As written, a real feed would import every product as advertiser "unknown" and possibly imageless — breaking the "zero code change" promise.
- FIX: multi-candidate column resolver in both files (kept in sync). advertiser → [advertiser, merchant_name, advertiser_name]; image → [aw_image_url, merchant_image_url, large_image]; id → [aw_product_id, merchant_product_id, product_id]; price → [search_price, store_price, display_price]; cat → [merchant_category, category_name, merchant_product_category_path]; desc, brand also aliased. Sample feed still parses (22 products, advertiser=SampleHome, all categories normalized).
- Gates green (tsc/lint/build); committed (5a4e6e8) + pushed main + deployed to prod. Cron stays inert until CRON_SECRET set — no behavior change, no tester needed.
- **Still pending USER ACTION (the only blocker):** create Awin publisher account (£5 refundable deposit) → apply to Maisons du Monde + La Redoute → Toolbox/Links & Tools/Create-a-Feed (CSV) → send Publisher ID + feed URL + approved advertisers. Then orchestrator sets `AWIN_FEED_URL` + `CRON_SECRET` in Vercel, runs one ingest, verifies real cards + affiliate tracking. RedNote launch owned by a separate agent (out of scope here).
- Awin signup correction: use the direct publisher signup `ui.awin.com/publisher-signup/en/awin/step1` (NOT the marketing getting-started page). No publisher "account type" to choose; "Awin Access" is an advertiser plan, irrelevant to us.

## Session 4 (cont.) — Stripe payment built (test-mode, deploy-inert)
- Decision: **Stripe**, not native WeChat Pay. Stripe supports WeChat Pay + Alipay as payment methods inside one account (one-click enable in dashboard once activated), so no Chinese entity needed — big win for the RedNote (Chinese-in-Europe) audience. Fees: EU cards ~1.5%+€0.25; WeChat/Alipay ~2.9%. No setup/monthly cost.
- Capacity briefing given to Liyang: serverless auto-scales; real limits are (1) generation cost ~€0.02-0.03/design you eat on free trials, (2) Supabase free 1GB storage ≈ 500-1000 images (first wall → Supabase Pro $25/mo), (3) Vercel Hobby forbids commercial use → Vercel Pro $20/mo once monetized. ~$45/mo infra baseline at monetization. Max users isn't a server limit, it's how much free generation you subsidize.
- **Built (dev sub-agent + orchestrator review):** `stripe@22.2.0`; `src/lib/packs.ts` (single source of truth, packs unchanged 20/€5, 60/€12 best, 150/€25); `src/lib/stripe.ts` (lazy client + isStripeConfigured); `POST /api/checkout` (auth, validate packIndex, Checkout Session, metadata user_id+credits, 503 if unconfigured); `POST /api/webhooks/stripe` (raw-body signature verify, idempotent via unique stripe_session_id, credits via service-role `add_credits_for` RPC, **payment_status='paid' guard** added by orchestrator so async WeChat/Alipay can't credit before payment lands). Migration `0006_stripe_credits.sql` applied to prod (add_credits_for SECURITY DEFINER **granted to service_role only** — sub-agent caught + fixed a default-PUBLIC-grant privilege-escalation bug; stripe_payments ledger table + RLS).
- Real `paymentService.purchase` POSTs /api/checkout → redirects to Stripe; if 503 (unconfigured) FlowProvider falls back to the existing mock credit bump so prod behavior is unchanged until keys land. AccountScreen refetches balance on `?purchase=success`.
- Gates green (tsc/lint/build). Committed `c0cc1b7` + pushed main. **NOT deployed** — holding for one clean deploy once test keys arrive.
- **PENDING USER ACTION:** create Stripe account (test mode), send `pk_test_...` + `sk_test_...` from Developers → API keys. Then orchestrator sets keys in `.env.local` + Vercel, deploys, registers webhook endpoint `…/api/webhooks/stripe` in Stripe (get `whsec_...`), and we test end-to-end with card 4242 4242 4242 4242. Going live later: activate account (ID + IBAN), switch to live keys, enable WeChat Pay + Alipay + add the `checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded` handler.
- **Shop list:** clarified to Liyang it's ALREADY live (Result-screen panel, sample feed). Recommended for Awin launch: Level 1 (feature it as an always-visible "Shop this look" strip under the after-image, grouped carousels) + Level 2 (attach the cached itemization to saved designs + share pages). Level 3 (dedicated Shopping/wishlist tab) deferred until click data exists. Offered to mock Level 1 visually.

## Session 4 (cont.) — Awin REJECTED → shop parked as "coming soon"
- **Awin rejected the publisher application** (generic "did not meet criteria" email). Diagnosis: standard new-site rejection — no traffic + `vercel.app` subdomain + app (not a content site). This filter exists at every serious network (Effiliation/Affilae/Kwanko/Tradedoubler vet for traffic too). The fix is the RedNote launch itself (traffic) + a custom domain; it's a chicken-and-egg the launch resolves.
- **Decision (Liyang):** package real shopping as an UPCOMING feature; revisit domain + affiliate reapplication only once RedNote shows traffic. Do not let affiliate approval gate the launch.
- **Built + deployed:** gated `ShopThisLook` behind `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOP_LIVE` (default off). Until set to "true", the "Shop this look" button stays (good RedNote teaser) but reveals a bilingual "coming soon" note instead of the sample products (whose buy links are placeholder `example.test` → would be dead at launch). Query is `enabled: SHOP_LIVE` so no /api/shop call when off. Committed `7d69595`, deployed to prod (gamma), gates green.
- **REACTIVATION STEPS (when traffic justifies it):** (1) buy a custom domain (~€10-15/yr), wire to Vercel; (2) reapply to Awin and/or apply to Effiliation (carries Maisons du Monde) + Affilae (carries La Redoute); Amazon.fr Associates = easy early catalog; (3) on approval set `AWIN_FEED_URL` + `CRON_SECRET` in Vercel, run one ingest (`node scripts/ingest-awin.mjs`), then set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOP_LIVE=true` + redeploy. Feed parser already hardened for real Awin column names (Session 4). Zero further code change.

## Session 4 (cont.) — Stripe LIVE in test mode + verified end-to-end
- Liyang created the Stripe account (FR, activated: details_submitted + charges_enabled). Sent test keys.
- Orchestrator wired it autonomously: stored keys in `.env.local` + Vercel (STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET, NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY); created the prod webhook endpoint via Stripe API (`we_...`, subscribed to checkout.session.completed + async_payment_succeeded, signing secret captured into env); deployed. Verified: /api/checkout returns a real checkout.stripe.com session for a logged-in user; webhook returns 400 (not 503) to unsigned calls = configured.
- **Tester PASS 5/5 (live prod, card 4242):** reset to 5 credits → bought 60-pack (€12) on real Stripe Checkout → redirected to /account?purchase=success → balance correctly became 65. Webhook credited the ledger server-side. Payment works end to end.
- **WeChat Pay + Alipay:** capabilities initially "not_requested"; Liyang enabled both in dashboard (Settings → Payment methods). Confirmed a fresh checkout session now resolves `["card","alipay","wechat_pay","link"]` — they will appear on the Stripe page. Our checkout is dashboard-driven (omits payment_method_types) so no code change needed for them to show. Added the `checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded` webhook handler so WeChat/Alipay (async settlement) actually credit. NOTE for go-live: re-verify WeChat/Alipay capabilities are active in LIVE mode (may need a short Stripe review).
- **Tester-flagged UX bug FIXED + deployed:** /account?purchase=success showed the OLD balance until a manual reload. Root cause: poll window was ~5s AND `router.replace` re-ran the effect and cancelled the poll mid-flight. Fix: strip the query param via `history.replaceState` (no effect re-run) + poll up to ~30s updating the balance live + graceful "credits will appear shortly" fallback. (`AccountScreen.tsx`, commit `4cf748e`.)
- Minor open items (non-blocking, flagged by tester): "Billing history" on Account still shows "None yet" (not wired to stripe_payments); two 404s on /account (likely a missing asset/endpoint). Cosmetic.
- **PENDING USER ACTION for real money:** activate live payments → switch to live keys (orchestrator repeats: set live keys + recreate webhook on prod) → confirm WeChat/Alipay active in live. Decision pending: restrict checkout to Card+WeChat+Alipay (drop Stripe Link) or leave all on.

## Session 4 (cont.) — Checkout payment-methods fix + Bohemian example regen
- **Stripe Checkout was showing a confusing SGD/EUR currency chooser (+4% fee) and only Card + Link, no WeChat/Alipay.** Root cause: Stripe **Adaptive Pricing** (local-currency conversion) only supports Card + Link and suppresses WeChat Pay / Alipay. Fix in `/api/checkout`: `adaptive_pricing: { enabled: false }` + explicit `payment_method_types: ["card","wechat_pay","alipay"]` (drops Link; card still covers Apple/Google Pay wallets) + `payment_method_options.wechat_pay.client="web"`. Verified via API: session now EUR, no currency_conversion, methods = card/wechat_pay/alipay. Also replaced an em-dash in the line-item name with a middot (rule). Commit `d88f019`, deployed.
- **Bohemian landing example regenerated** (`public/examples/proof_boho.jpg`): the old asset had collapsed the room's 3-panel window into 2, breaking the fidelity promise on the landing page. Regenerated from `room-before.jpg` via fal Qwen with the production architecture-lock prompt (added an explicit "three-panel window, keep exactly three panels" clause), generated 3 candidates, picked the faithful one, optimized to 159KB JPEG via sharp. Scandi + Japandi proofs verified faithful (3 panels), left unchanged. Commit `d147813`, deployed. (Note: static asset, same filename → users may need a hard refresh.)
- Reusable learning: for landing/marketing example images, prompt should name the exact window panel count; generation can still drift on architecture, so generate a few candidates and eyeball-pick.

## Session 4 (cont.) — Auth UX pass (sign-in flow)
- Bugs/asks from Liyang's QA of the auth flow, all fixed + deployed:
  - **"Sign out" showed for guests** (red, and clicking it opened the sign-in sheet). Now shows **"Sign in"** when no user, "Sign out" only when signed in. (`AccountScreen.tsx`)
  - **Google button** now uses the **official multicolor Google logo** (was a blue "G" monogram). `BrandBtn` gained an optional `icon` slot; `GoogleGMark` SVG in `Sheet.tsx`.
  - **WeChat login removed** (Liyang's call) — it was a "Soon" placeholder, not built (real WeChat web login needs a registered company + WeChat Open Platform app).
  - **Email sign-in streamlined from magic-link → in-app 6-digit OTP code**: user reads a code from the email and types it in the app (no leaving the app, no fragile redirect — much better on mobile/PWA). `authService.verifyEmailOtp` added (`supabase.auth.verifyOtp type:"email"`); `signIn('email')` sends the code (no emailRedirectTo). Supabase magic-link email template updated via Management API to feature `{{ .Token }}`, subject "Your Roomora sign-in code". AuthModal is now a 2-step sheet (email → code) with resend / change-email.
- **Auth config facts (live):** email + Google enabled; `mailer_autoconfirm=false`; **no custom SMTP** → built-in email **capped at 2 emails/hour** (project-wide) and can't be raised without SMTP (confirmed: PATCH of rate_limit_email_sent rejected without SMTP). Google may show an "unverified app" warning until Google verifies the app (needs privacy policy + submission).
- **OPEN / RECOMMENDED — email deliverability:** for real RedNote volume (and Chinese inboxes qq.com/163.com), set up **custom SMTP (Resend)** in Supabase Auth. Pairs well with the deferred custom domain (deliverability). Liyang leaned "email is the way" but was lukewarm on Resend; needs a Resend account (his action) to wire. Until then the OTP flow works but is throttled to 2/hour.

## Session 4 (cont.) — Switched to email + password auth (Liyang's call)
- Liyang chose **email + password** signup (like a classic form he shared) over passwordless. Reasoning that won it: password auth removes the email dependency for day-to-day login (returning users just type a password, no email round-trip → not blocked by the 2/hour built-in email cap).
- **Checked the tennis-pwa app** (`AI-Projects/tennis-pwa`) per Liyang: it used **Gmail SMTP** (`smtp.gmail.com:587` + a **Gmail App Password**, env `GMAIL_ADDRESS`/`GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`) to send all email, and custom JWT auth. Reusable insight = Gmail SMTP; we keep Supabase for the actual auth (don't reinvent JWT/hashing).
- **Built + deployed:** AuthModal is now a name/email/password/confirm **signup** form + a **Sign in** mode toggle ("Already have an account? Sign in"), Roomora-styled, Google one-tap kept on top. `authService.signUp` + `signInWithPassword` (Supabase). Removed the OTP-code flow. Set Supabase `mailer_autoconfirm=true` → **instant signup, no email sent**, sidesteps the 2/hour limit; +3 credits still granted by the signup trigger. Verified vs prod API: signup returns an instant session with `full_name` metadata, `email_confirmed_at` set. Commit `734786b`.
- **NEXT (email for password reset / optional verification):** wire **Gmail SMTP** into Supabase Auth (Settings → Auth → SMTP): host `smtp.gmail.com`, port 587, user = Liyang's Gmail, pass = a Gmail **App Password** (needs 2FA on → myaccount.google.com/apppasswords → generate "Mail"). ~500/day, no rate limit. Until then: signup/login work fully (no email), but "forgot password" has no delivery yet (forgot-password UI not built yet either). Gmail deliverability to cn inboxes (qq/163) still imperfect → a real domain + provider later for scale.
- Note: brand line "No passwords, ever" was dropped (we now use passwords).

## Session 4 (cont.) — Gmail SMTP wired into Supabase
- Reused the tennis app's Gmail sender (`AI-Projects/tennis-pwa/backend/.env`): address `paristennis.booking.assistant@gmail.com` + its App Password. Configured **Supabase Auth custom SMTP** via Management API: `smtp_host=smtp.gmail.com`, port 587, user=that Gmail, sender_name="Roomora", and raised `rate_limit_email_sent=30` (now allowed since custom SMTP is active). Creds live ONLY in Supabase auth config (server-side), not in app env/Vercel.
- Test send (OTP to the Gmail inbox) returned HTTP 200 = accepted + dispatched via SMTP. Liyang to confirm receipt in that inbox.
- **Branding caveat (flagged):** emails send from a tennis-booking address with display name "Roomora". Works, but for clean branding + better deliverability, create a dedicated Roomora Gmail (or real domain) later and swap `smtp_user`/`smtp_admin_email`/`smtp_pass`.
- ~~Not built yet: a "Forgot password?" flow~~ → **BUILT (next entry).**

## Session 4 (cont.) — Password reset flow
- **Built + deployed** (commit `ec4b232`): Sign-in mode now has a **"Forgot password?"** link → `authService.resetPassword(email)` (`resetPasswordForEmail`, redirectTo `/auth/callback?next=/auth/reset`). New client page **`/auth/reset`** confirms the recovery session, takes a new password + confirm, calls `supabase.auth.updateUser({password})`, then routes home signed in. Invalid/expired links show a clear message. Redirect allowlist already covers it (`…/**`).
- Live send check: `POST /auth/v1/recover` to the Gmail inbox returned 200 (reset email dispatched via SMTP).
- **Caveat (PKCE):** the reset link must be opened on the **same browser/device** that requested it (the code_verifier cookie lives there). Fine for the typical mobile flow (request + open on the same phone); cross-device would fail. Acceptable for launch.
- Recovery email still uses Supabase's **default template** (not Roomora-branded) — polish later if desired.

## Session 4 (cont.) — Custom domain room-ora.com + desktop framing
- Liyang bought **room-ora.com** and connected it in Vercel (now aliased; app serves there, no console errors).
- **Domain rewiring done:** Supabase `site_url=https://room-ora.com` + `uri_allow_list` now includes `https://room-ora.com/**` and `https://www.room-ora.com/**` (kept vercel.app + localhost). Vercel `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` updated to `https://room-ora.com` + redeployed. Auth (Google/reset redirects) + checkout origin now work on the new domain. Stripe webhook stays on the vercel.app URL (both domains serve the same app, so it still resolves) — fine, no change needed.
- **Desktop layout fix** (`AppShell.tsx`): app was a lonely 480px column on flat bg at desktop widths. Now on `md+` the app sits in a centered rounded "device" frame (border + soft shadow, `h-[min(900px,94vh)]`, internal scroll) over a Sauge gradient canvas. Mobile unchanged (full-screen). Verified via desktop screenshot (1440x900) — looks intentional. Commit `a2da2b6`.
- Possible future (not needed for launch): a true desktop **Landing** layout (two-column, larger before/after) for first impressions; the rest of the app is fine as the framed device.
- Domain follow-ups (minor, not blocking): ensure www→apex works in Vercel; add room-ora.com to Google Cloud OAuth "authorized domains" when submitting for Google verification.

## Session 4 (cont.) — Brand mark + PWA install (per gtm-assets/SPEC-pwa-install-and-icon.md)
- **(0) Logo** (`Logo.tsx`): swapped the "R" glyph for the new 3-green mark (viewBox 0 0 2048 1928), knocked out in white inside the sage rounded square (matches the app icon). Wordmark kept. Verified in-app via desktop screenshot.
- **(A) Home-screen icon:** copied sage icons → `src/app/apple-icon.png` (180), `src/app/icon.png` (192), `public/icon-192.png`, `public/icon-512.png`; added `src/app/manifest.ts` (name Roomora, standalone, bg #F6F3EA, theme #7C8866, 192 + 512 + maskable 512); `layout.tsx` gained `appleWebApp` metadata + `viewport.themeColor=#7C8866`. Verified on prod head: theme-color, `<link rel=manifest>`, apple-touch-icon (180), icon (192) all emitted; `/apple-icon.png` + `/icon.png` + `/manifest.webmanifest` all 200.
- **(B) InstallHint** (`src/components/ui/InstallHint.tsx`, client): rendered once in `AppShell` (auto-skips `/share/*` via the existing early return). iOS Safari (non-standalone, not dismissed) → bilingual "Share → Add to Home Screen" bottom banner; Android → captures `beforeinstallprompt`, shows an Install button; hides on `appinstalled`; dismissal persisted in `localStorage('roomora_install_hint')`. Standalone → renders nothing. Sauge Doré styling. (Had to `eslint-disable react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` on the iOS branch — mount-time UA detection is correct; lazy init would break SSR hydration.)
- Gates green (tsc/lint/build). Commit `4a8f677`, deployed to room-ora.com.
- **Concern:** final "sage icon on the iPhone home screen" needs Liyang's actual device (can't verify headlessly) — but everything that drives it (apple-touch-icon.png served + linked, manifest, theme-color) is confirmed correct, so it will show the sage R, not the grey box.
- Minor optional: old `src/app/favicon.ico` (grey R) still present → browser tab may still show it on some browsers; delete it later so the new `icon.png` is the favicon everywhere.

## Open threads
- Engine choice pending spike (MiniMax vs Qwen). Needs MINIMAX_API_KEY + FAL_KEY + 3–5 room photos.
- Supabase project not yet created (Phase 2).
- GitHub remote + Vercel project not yet created (no `gh` CLI on this machine — will push via https remote or user creates repo).
