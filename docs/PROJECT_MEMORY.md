# Roomora — Project Memory

Session log. Append at the end of every session.

## Session 1 — 2026-05-31 — Day 1 setup
- Approved plan: Next.js 16 full-stack, free-credits-first, parallel kickoff. Plan file: `~/.claude/plans/here-is-the-claude-hashed-biscuit.md`.
- Scaffolded `roomora-app/` via create-next-app → **Next.js 16.2.6, React 19, Tailwind v4, TS, src dir, App Router**. Git initialized inside `roomora-app/`.
- Read Next 16 docs (server/client components, Tailwind v4 CSS `@theme`, `next/font`). Captured gotchas + Sauge Doré tokens + three-agent operating mode in `CLAUDE.md`.
- Added `.env.local.example`, `.env.test.example`.
- i18n decision: replicate prototype's inline `t(en,zh)` via a lightweight `useT()` hook over Zustand `lang` (not react-i18next), for fast, exact parity.
- Next: frontend dev sub-agent ports tokens/fonts/primitives/slider/all screens/modals/mock services (Tasks #2–#3). Engine spike (#4) waits on user keys + photos.

## Open threads
- Engine choice pending spike (MiniMax vs Qwen). Needs MINIMAX_API_KEY + FAL_KEY + 3–5 room photos.
- Supabase project not yet created (Phase 2).
- GitHub remote + Vercel project not yet created (no `gh` CLI on this machine — will push via https remote or user creates repo).
